Parameters
^^^^^^^^^^

AFF3CT contains many arguments classified in three categories:

:Required: identified by the |image_required_argument| image, they are
   needed to launch a simulation.
:Optional: set up the simulation in many ways instead of the default
   configuration.
:Advanced: identified by the |image_advanced_argument| image, they lead
   to a more extensive use of the simulator.


The first arguments are those of the simulation. They settle the more important
part, the simulation and the code types.
Then come arguments that are also classified in function of the module of the
chain they impact.
