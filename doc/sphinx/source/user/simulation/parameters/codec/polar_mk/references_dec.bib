  abstract = {A method is proposed, called channel polarization, to construct code sequences that achieve the symmetric capacity I(W) of any given binary-input discrete memoryless channel (B-DMC) W. The symmetric capacity is the highest rate achievable subject to using the input letters of the channel with equal probability. Channel polarization refers to the fact that it is possible to synthesize, out of N independent copies of a given B-DMC W, a second set of N binary-input channels {WN(i)1 les i les N} such that, as N becomes large, the fraction of indices i for which I(WN(i)) is near 1 approaches I(W) and the fraction for which I(WN(i)) is near 0 approaches 1-I(W). The polarized channels {WN(i)} are well-conditioned for channel coding: one need only send data at rate 1 through those with capacity near 1 and at rate 0 through the remaining. Codes constructed on the basis of this idea are called polar codes. The paper proves that, given any B-DMC W with I(W) $>$ 0 and any target rate R$<$ I(W) there exists a sequence of polar codes {Cfrn;nges1} such that Cfrn has block-length N=2n , rate ges R, and probability of block error under successive cancellation decoding bounded as Pe(N,R) les O(N-1/4) independently of the code rate. This performance is achievable by encoders and decoders with complexity O(N logN) for each.},

  abstract  = {We describe a successive-cancellation list decoder for polar codes, which is a generalization of the classic successive-cancellation decoder of Arikan. In the proposed list decoder, up to L decoding paths are considered concurrently at each decoding stage. Simulation results show that the resulting performance is very close to that of a maximum-likelihood decoder, even for moderate values of L. Thus it appears that the proposed list decoder bridges the gap between successive-cancellation and maximum-likelihood decoding of polar codes. The specific list-decoding algorithm that achieves this performance doubles the number of decoding paths at each decoding step, and then uses a pruning procedure to discard all but the L {\textquotedblleft}best{\textquotedblright} paths. In order to implement this algorithm, we introduce a natural pruning criterion that can be easily evaluated. Nevertheless, straightforward implementation still requires O(L $\cdot$ n\textsuperscript{2}) time, which is in stark contrast with the O(n log n) complexity of the original successive-cancellation decoder. We utilize the structure of polar codes to overcome this problem. Specifically, we devise an efficient, numerically stable, implementation taking only O(L $\cdot$ n log n) time and O(L $\cdot$ n) space.},
