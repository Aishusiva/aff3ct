  abstract = {It is shown in this paper that the iterative algorithm introduced by Berlekamp for decoding BCH codes actually provides a general solution to the problem of synthesizing the shortest linear feedback shift register capable of generating a prescribed finite sequence of digits. The shift-register approach leads to a simple proof of the validity of the algorithm as well as providing additional insight into its properties. The equivalence of the decoding problem for BCH codes to a shift-register synthesis problem is demonstrated, and other applications for the algorithm are suggested.},
